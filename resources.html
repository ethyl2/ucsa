                >Hope In Christ</a>
                <p>By President M. Russell Ballard</p>
                <p class="max-w-5xl px-4 md:px-0"><span class="text-cyan-200">Brothers and sisters, more than half of adults in the Church today are widowed, divorced, or not yet married.</span> 
                    Some wonder about their opportunities and place in God's plan and in the Church. 
                    We should understand that eternal life is not simply a question of current marital status but of discipleship and being “valiant in the testimony of Jesus.”
                    The hope of all who are single is the same as for all members of the Lord's restored Church—access to the grace of Christ through “obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.”</p>

                        <h4 class="text-center font-bold text-lg max-w-2xl md:text-xl">Scriptures and latter-day prophets confirm that everyone who is faithful in keeping gospel covenants will have the opportunity for exaltation.</h4>
                        <p class="w-full max-w-xl">President Russell M. Nelson taught: “In the Lord's own way and time, no blessing will be withheld from His faithful Saints. 
                            The Lord will judge and reward each individual according to heartfelt desire as well as deed.”</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center bg-white text-black rounded-md p-6 lg:p-8 lg:max-w-4xl w-full space-y-4 md:space-y-6">
                        <div class="w-12 h-12 rounded-full bg-cyan-700 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold text-xl">2</div>
                        <h4 class="text-center font-bold text-lg max-w-2xl md:text-xl">The precise time and manner in which the blessings of exaltation are bestowed have not all been revealed, but they are nonetheless assured.</h4>
                        <p class="w-full max-w-xl">President Dallin H. Oaks explained that some of the circumstances 
                            “of mortality will be set right in the Millennium, which is the time for fulfilling all that is incomplete in the great plan of happiness for all of our Father's worthy children.”
                        </p>
                        <p class="w-full max-w-xl">That doesn't mean that every blessing is deferred until the Millennium; some have already been received, and others will continue to be received until that day.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center bg-white text-black rounded-md p-6 lg:p-8 lg:max-w-4xl w-full space-y-4 md:space-y-6">
                        <div class="w-12 h-12 rounded-full bg-cyan-600 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold text-xl">3</div>
                        <h4 class="text-center font-bold text-lg max-w-2xl md:text-xl">Waiting upon the Lord implies continued obedience and spiritual progress toward Him.</h4>
                        <p class="w-full max-w-xl">Waiting upon the Lord does not imply biding one's time. You should never feel like you are in a <span class="italic">waiting</span> room.</p>

                        <p class="w-full max-w-xl p-3 rounded-md bg-cyan-100 font-semibold leading-loose">Waiting upon the Lord implies action. I have learned over the years that our hope in Christ increases when we serve others. Serving as Jesus served, we naturally increase our hope in Him.</p>

                        <p class="w-full max-w-xl">The personal growth one can achieve now while waiting upon the Lord and His promises is an invaluable, sacred element of His plan for each one of us. The contributions one can make now to help build up the Church on earth and to gather Israel are much needed. 
                            Marital status has nothing to do with one's capacity to serve. The Lord honors those who serve and wait upon Him in patience and faith.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center bg-white text-black rounded-md p-6 lg:p-8 lg:max-w-4xl w-full space-y-4 md:space-y-6">

                        <h4 class="text-center font-bold text-lg max-w-2xl md:text-xl">God offers eternal life to all of His children.</h4>
                        <p class="w-full max-w-xl">All those who accept the Savior's gracious gift of repentance and live His commandments will receive eternal life, even though they do not attain to all its characteristics and perfections in mortality. 
                            Those who repent will experience the Lord's readiness to forgive, as He has assured: “Yea, and as often as my people repent will I forgive them their trespasses against me.”</p>
                        <p class="w-full max-w-xl">In the final analysis, a person's capacity, desires, and opportunities in matters of agency and choice, including qualification for eternal blessings, are matters only the Lord can judge.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center bg-white text-black rounded-md p-6 lg:p-8 lg:max-w-4xl w-full space-y-4 md:space-y-6">

                        <h4 class="text-center font-bold text-lg max-w-2xl md:text-xl">Our confidence in these assurances is rooted in our faith in Jesus Christ, by whose grace all things pertaining to mortality are set right.</h4>
                        <p class="w-full max-w-xl">All promised blessings are made possible through Him, who, by His Atonement, 
                            “descended below all things” and has “overcome the world.” He “hath sat down on the right hand of God, 
                            to claim of the Father his rights of mercy which he hath upon the children of men … ; wherefore he advocateth the cause of the children of men.”
                            In the end, “the saints shall be filled with his glory, and receive their inheritance” as “joint-heirs with Christ.”</p>
                    </div>

                <p class="max-w-5xl pt-10 px-4 md:px-0"><span class="text-cyan-200">
                    Never forget that you are a child of God, our Eternal Father, now and forever. He loves you, and the Church wants and needs you. Yes, we need you! We need your voices, talents, skills, goodness, and righteousness.

                            saying as we sip another glass of lemonade, 
                            “Lord, give me all thy choicest virtues, but be certain not to give me grief, nor sorrow, nor pain, nor opposition. 
                            Please do not let anyone dislike me or betray me, and above all, do not ever let me feel forsaken by Thee or those I love. 
                            <span class="font-semibold text-blue-500">In fact, Lord, be careful to keep me from all the experiences that made Thee divine.</span> 
                            And then, when the rough sledding by everyone else is over, please let me come and dwell with Thee, 
                            where I can boast about how similar our strengths and our characters are as I float along on my cloud of comfortable Christianity.”
                        </p>

                            My beloved brothers and sisters, Christianity is comforting, but it is often not comfortable. 
                            The path to holiness and happiness here and hereafter is a long and sometimes rocky one. 
                            It takes time and tenacity to walk it. <span class="font-semibold text-blue-500">But, of course, the reward for doing so is monumental.</span></p>

                    <p  class="leading-relaxed">"We know that many single adults are facing difficult challenges or have questions or concerns," 
                        said Elder Andersen, adding that "the Savior's love can heal every sorrow. We hope to be able to share the incomparable love of the Savior with our friends around the world."

                    <p class="leading-relaxed">Single adults make up over 50 percent of the adult membership of the Church, noted Sister Bingham. 
                        "That is a significant audience!"" she said. "We look forward to having a conversation with them about their contributions to the kingdom, their capacity to serve others, and their love of the Lord Jesus Christ."</p>
                        
                    <p  class="leading-relaxed">Sister Eubanks said that as a single adult herself, 
                        she is happy to have this open conversation with other single adults. "Every member, no matter their circumstances, has so much to contribute," she said, 
                        "and we hope to better recognize this of members of the Church."</p>
                    
                    <p>Added Elder Andersen, "To those adults, whether you have never been married or are widowed, divorced, or a single parent, <span class="text-cyan-200 font-bold">you are needed in God's kingdom.
